        I will monitor the target stocks regularly and will be ready to move out of a position only

        If I reach the end of a year period and have still not seen a time that I’ve found
        appropriate to invest in any of the target stocks, I must invest all contributions for that
        year by Dec 31 and will do so by splitting the cash on hand between all target stocks
